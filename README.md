## Animal-Conservation-Mosaic-Plot

This is a web scraper that pulls data from Wikipedia about animal conservation. The dataset is cleaned and visualized using a mosaic plot.
The dataset was narrowed down to only include data on Mammalia, Aves and Reptilia animal classes and Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable conservation
statuses. This project was a solid introduction into building web scrapers, cleaning and narrowing data and data visualization.
